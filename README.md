# Linear-Regression


Linear regression is a basic and commonly used type of predictive analysis. 

These regression estimates are used to explain the relationship between one dependent variable and one or more independent variables.  The simplest form of the regression equation with one dependent and one independent variable is defined by the formula y = c + b*x, where y = estimated dependent variable score, c = constant, b = regression coefficient, and x = score on the independent variable.


Three major uses for regression analysis are:</n>

<b>1.</b>Determining the strength of predictors.</n>

<b>2.</b> Forecasting an effect. </n>

<b>3.</b> Trend forecasting.</n>

In this notebook, we use an advertising dataset to predict the sales of TVs, Radios and Newspapers.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

The linear regression model did not perform as well as expected. To improve the model, we can use more data. The advertising dataset contains 200 records only. Another way of improving the model is to add artificial neural networks.
